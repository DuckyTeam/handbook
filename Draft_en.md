> «A guide telling you what to do when no one tells you.»

#### Preface:
In order to create solutions that impact the world in a positive way, we believe we must first create a workplace that fosters goodness. Ducky shall be a workplace where you can contribute with all that you are while having fun along the way. Ducky's goals are important, men what is more important are the ideas, the creativity and the engagement of each individual working together to achieve these goals. Ducky's employee philosophy is based on the fundemental principles that people will help if given the oppurtunity and that we all have equal worth. At Ducky, the most important is not to strengthen one's ego and power, but rather to contribute as well as possible to make our collegaues the best they can possibly be and through this strengthen the organization as a whole and it's cohesion within. Ducky function as an ecosystem where the individual is open to new impulses and ideas. Through this we secure dynamic growth based on choises that feel right. In an ecosystem, some direction will fail and some will succeed. At Ducky we see these leaps of faith as a positive thing, even if the attempt may fail.

#### 1	Regarding Ducky

##### 1.1	Our purpose
To motivate as many people as possible to live sustainable lives.

##### 1.2	What are our goals?
We want to motivate people to live sustainable lives. By this we mean in social, economic and ecological conditions. It's important to remember that these aspect are closely linked and the best solutions promote all three elements of sustainability. Ducky is working to discover good solutions that lead to a happy nature, happy people and an economy that ensures the necessary resources in a long term perspective. We work to fulfill our mission by being a positive and credible information channel locally, nationally and internationally and at all venues where Ducky is present.

##### 1.3	How shall Ducky as an organization do this?

Ducky explores alternative ways to organize the daily operation of the company. This is done to create a dream workplace with an organizational culture that promotes values we want to find in a sustainable society. A culture where employees have the opportunity to reflect on and influence their work in line with a common and sustainable purposes. Through freedom, influence and resources available for employees Ducky have the potential to grow in multiple directions within the frame of it's purpose. It exists therefore a great potential to influence individuals, businesses, schools, governments, global trade and more should initiatives be launched to cover this.

#### 2	Important when working at Ducky

##### 2.1	1st principle - We are led by purpose
There are no official leaders at Ducky, and we are basically free to make decisions as long as it is in line with our aim. Learn more about how this could work in practice in Chapter 3.

##### 2.2	2nd principle - The whole human person present at work
At Ducky we want to avoid people wearing a mask at work, for example by pretending to be competent in every situation, acting invulnerable or never making mistakes. At Ducky we never do things that contradict our inner sence of right and wrong and we are happy to share both positive and negative experiences with our colleagues. If you wish to develop as a person you have the possibility to take classes , get coaching, reflect upon yourself or through other means get to know yourself and your collegaues better. We must each decide what is important for us and at Ducky. In the case of an extensive or expensive course you should consult with your collegaues and make an argument regarding why and how the course will serve the organization and it's purpose.

##### 2.3	3rd principle - Codetermination
All coworkers have an equal right and duty in deciding how Ducky shall be governed. In normal day-to-day decisions there is no demand for concensus, but in major decisions colleagues must be consulted.
Important decisions can be taken in one of two ways:
1. In a meeting dedicated to decisions, which may be done the following way:
a. A coworker propose a project, things they want to work on, choice of strategy, roles they wish to take on or the like.
b. All participants as a group will then try to optimize the proposal.
c. All participants are then given the oppurtunity to raise objections.
d. Unless no valid arguments against the proposal in made, ie why this is not good for Ducky, the proposal can be implemnted.
2.	Inquire with experts and all affected employees.
If we wish to implement a proposal we can inquire experts in the field it regards, as well as all emplyees that are affected by the proposal. We can then seek advice how best to implement it. If those emplyees that are affacted deems the proposal to be good it can be implemented.
This way of implementing decisions ensures, among other things, the following:
* That many people are educated.
* That coworkers feel valued and involved.
* That good decisions since decisions are made by those that will live with the consequenses.
* That the decision is owned by the coworkers.
* That we have fun in the process.
* The possibility for everyone to initiate important processes, for example if some collegaues see new oppurtunities that are according to our goals, they can pursue these. As another example, should they want to set up an office elsewhere they can do this after consulting with their colleagues. In this way we achieve dynamic growth without the need of organization by a leader.
